# SecureOps-Project

## Overview
The **SecureOps-Project** is focused on enhancing the security and operational efficiency of cloud infrastructure and DevOps processes. This project utilizes **Terraform VCS (Version Control System) integration** for automating infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments and follows best practices for security, monitoring, and continuous deployment.

## Objectives
- Ensure robust cloud infrastructure security.
- Automate DevOps workflows using Terraform VCS.

## Features
- **Terraform CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate the deployment of infrastructure using Terraform's VCS integration.
- **Cloud Security**: Harden the cloud infrastructure by applying security best practices.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS
- **CI/CD Tools**: Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (VCS-Integrated)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Security Tools**: Vault, AWS IAM

## CI/CD with Terraform VCS

This project leverages **Terraform Cloud's VCS-driven workflows** for automated infrastructure deployment. Hereâ€™s an overview of the process:

### Setup Overview:
1. **Terraform VCS Integration**: Connects your GitHub or GitLab repository to Terraform Cloud.
   - The repository contains your Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files).
2. **Automatic Plan and Apply**:
   - Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, Terraform triggers a plan to evaluate the changes.
   - After review, approved changes are automatically applied to the infrastructure.
3. **Workspaces**: Terraform Workspaces are used to manage environments (e.g., staging, production).
4. **Variables and Secrets**: Terraform Cloud securely manages environment variables and sensitive information.

### CI/CD Workflow:
- **Push Changes to VCS**: Any change pushed to the repository triggers a Terraform plan.
- **Automated Plan**: Terraform evaluates the proposed changes and generates an execution plan.
- **Manual or Automated Apply**: After review (manual approval or auto-approval based on policies), the plan is applied.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1: Project Initialization
- **Task**: Setup GitHub repository and Terraform VCS integration.
- **Actions**: 
  - Initialize GitHub repository and created basic Terraform configuration files.
  - Integrate GitHub repository with Terraform Cloud for automatic plan and apply.
  - Define Terraform workspace structure for each day.
- **Outcome**: GitHub repository and Terraform Cloud are connected, with basic CI/CD workflow in place.

### Day 3 & 4: Cloud Infrastructure Setup with Terraform
- **Task**: Configure the cloud infrastructure setup and improve the CI/CD pipeline by managing sensitive variables and configurations.
- **Actions**:
  - Configure environment variables and secrets (e.g., AWS access keys) in Terraform Cloud.
  - Configure VPC, subnets, and routing for the cloud infrastructure.
- **Outcome**: Cloud infrastructure setup is complete, managed through Terraform VCS workflow.

  - When using dynamic AWS credentials in Terraform to configure resources, the credentials are generated for each plan and apply step. However, since these credentials have a short time-to-live (TTL), they may expire after the plan phase is complete, leading to errors during the apply phase if the credentials are no longer valid.

  - We need to set certain environment variables in our HCP Terraform workspace to authenticate HCP Terraform with AWS using Vault-backed dynamic credentials. https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/vault-backed/aws-configuration

### Day 5: Setup VPC Peering with Terraform
- **Task**: Setup VPC Peering between HCP HVN Network and AWS VPC.
- **Actions**:
  - Configure environment variables and secrets (same as Day 3 and 4) in Terraform Cloud.
  - Configure VPC Peering and update route table.
- **Outcome**: Cloud infrastructure setup is complete, managed through Terraform VCS workflow.
